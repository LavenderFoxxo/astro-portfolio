      Hiya! Nice to meet you, and thanks for checking out my portfolio! Here's a
      little about me: I'm Alexander as you may know. I'm a full-stack <i
        >(I don't even know if I can say that haha)</i
      > developer with a preferred preference for backend development. I'm a
      relative simple person, I got into coding around the age of 16! My first
      ever Discord.JS bot, yikes that was a disaster. A few fun facts about me
      is, I love to read <i>(I'm currently reading Warrior Cats!)</i> and I'm a <s
        >furry</s
      > but pretend you never heard that ;)
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p class="text-xl mt-3 font-medium">
      I've worked in a variety of places! Some notable ones would be, <b
        >TruckyMods</b
      >, <b>Relatio</b> and, <b>Omero Systems</b> and that just scratches the
      surface. If you want to take a look at a project of mines, why not check
      out <span class="font-bold underline underline-offset-1"
        ><a href="https://github.com/lavenderfoxxo/fluff">Fluff</a></span
      >? It's a furry discord bot that has been on and off development wise,
      however I'm very proud of it!
